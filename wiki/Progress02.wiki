 * Striked-out items mean they are completed, _not_ removed (consider this my personal checklist :P)




==Features for next version:==

  * Clans
  * Multiple Recipients for mail
  * Friends list to mail them easily and to see if they are online
  * Battle with AI (monsters)
  * AI players (used by admin to disguise as real players, so game looks populated)
     * Actually, they are just programmed to do actions in a separate cron file every so often (time can be changed by GM themselves, no option in admin panel. must be changed in cron scheduling).
  * Training area to train stats/max health/max energy, maybe some other stuff as well.
